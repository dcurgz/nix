.Nd An explanation for this website. (WIP)
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
After a long time of planning to do it and putting it off, I've finally
committed to a domain name, the relevant infrastructure, and an overall
direction for my personal website.
.Pp
I've noticed, talking about it to friends, a recurring pattern of mild to
moderate confusion about why I would want a personal blog in the first place. I
understand that it's fairly unusual broadly, and even in my particular social
spheres, but I do find it ironic.
.Pp
I'm trying my best to avoid sounding bitter about this - I'm really
.Em not
bitter about it - but I notice that, at least from my generation, there's no
surprise associated with, say, posting on mainstream social media. Creating and
maintaining an active Instagram account that documents your life, for example,
is considered completely normal amongst my generation. In fact, I've noticed
quite a bit of friction getting to know people, especially in dating, as a
result of not using Instagram in this way. My best guess is that the disparity
in surprise is down to the prevalent normalization of social media usage today,
and some assumptions about what a personal blog is all about.
.Pp
Either way, I don't blame people for being confused about it, but it does mean
I feel the need to keep justifying its existence in partial or full form, so I
figured it would probably be best to just write something down. So, these are
(most) of the reasons why this website exists.

First of all, on the topic of justification, I have a bit of a problem with
over-explaining myself. If you're a friend of mine you're probably aware of
this already. I think that this basically happens because I'm not very good at
expressing myself in verbal language on the fly; my spoken thoughts in
conversation can be incoherent, sometimes irrelevant, and hard to follow. So
I'm often left feeling unsatisifed and misunderstood after trying to explain
something that means a lot to me. My theory is that by posting some of these
ramblings here, in written form, I can better come to understand my own
thoughts, which can help me to explain myself succinctly and precisely when I
need to. In this light, the function of this website can be seen as a public
journal; writing is editing, and editing is thinking[0], so this website will
be how I will think about things. I could do that in private, but...
.It
I'm a huge fan of other people's technical blogs. Over the last three years
I've learned so much from random internet pages people have put online; it's
what got me into NixOS, and they have nudged my thinking on topics in ways that
I cannot quite enumerate but can only acknowledge to be profound. By technical,
usually I mean blog posts about technology e.g. system architecture, reverse
engineering, security practices, etc. but I've also found immense value in the
writing of strangers about their personal lives or problems they've faced and
overcome. I don't follow people on social media, so these niche internet
webpages have filled a huge gap in my life when it comes to inspiration and
wider reading. I feel a considerable pull to join this community of people
posting silly or thoughtful pieces to an audience of friends and strangers; I
want to give back to the internet that which it has given me, and join in on
all of the fun.

No Boilerplate's "Writing at the Speed of Thought", and some of his other
videos, have really sold to me the value of writing in helping you think
recently.
